The _new world is so close…
G. C5. G5. C..
...close my _eyes I can _see the _streets paven with gold…
G. C5. G. C5.
[instrumental]
Am. G....
_Salted wind on my face, as I _dream of the place
Am.. G5. C5. C.
where the _bright opportunities _soon'd un_fold

#v
G. C5. G5. C.
Then a _shudder..._With a _sickening _scraping
G. C5. G. C5.
a_long the _port _bow…
Am. C. G..
Then a_nother..._Then a deckhand is running by,
Am
calling out urgently, "follow me now."

#v
F5.. G. Am.
Lead and _ice in my _veins, as we _lurch in the waves,
F. Am.. C5. G.
But a _look in his _eyes' saying, "_try to be brave."

#c
C. G. Am. F.
So I'll _form the _line as the _lifeboats get ready,
C. G. Am. F.
And you'll _find the _crew and make _sure they all know.
C. G. Am. F.
And he'll _ring the _bell as the _ship tilts unsteady,
C. G. Am. F.
_Waking the _passengers _sleeping be_low.

F.. G. C.
[instrumental]

#c
Am.. F. C. G.
And I'll _run as _fast as I _can to the _tower
Am. F.. C.
and _send the dis_tress call, and pray that I'm wrong
Am.. F.
and tell any _ships to di_vert all their power to engines,
C. G.
come _quickly, we don't have that long.
Am. F. Am. F. G.
As the first life_boat's _waiting a_lone for the _dawn.

#b
Am. F.
And it _waits with its sisters, in the cold midnight air.

Not sure if they'll make it.

I hope that they make it.

Hope somebody lives,

Hope somebody lives, somewhere.

Dm. F. Am. F.
There's a _stutter…_…and some _lights flicker _out
Am. F. Am. F. G.
as she _starts to des_cend to her _grave

#v
C. G. Am. F.
People _mutter…_There's a _rumor the _nearest ship's
C. G. Am. F.
_too many _hours a_way.

#v
C. G. Am. F.
There _aren't e_nough boats and there's _not enough _time
C. G. Am. F.
and there's _not e_nough crew who can _hold down the _line.

#c
C. G. Am. F.
So I'll _climb the _deck and ask _"who's gonna step up?"
C. G. Am. F.
And you'll _track the _list of things _left we can try.
C. G. Am. F.
And they'll _search the _boat for any_thing that can float,
C. G. Am. F.
and for _blankets and _coats so folk _don't freeze tonight.

#c
C. G. Am. F.
And you'll _find the _blueprints, and _we'll look 'em over
C. G. Am. F.
and _see if there's _anything _else left to do.
C. G. Am. F.
Then we'll _turn the _rusted wheels _sealing the valve closed,
C. G. Am. F.
that _maybe will _buy us an _hour or two...
F.. G. C.
...as the _next life_boat settles _down into the blue…

Dm. F. Am. F.
As we _load the _last boat, I _don't know what to say
Am. F. Am. F. G.
to the _too many _people still _looking my _way.
Am. F. Am. F.
And we're _tilting _hard, all thirty nine _thousand _tonnes.
Am. F. Am. F.
And I'm _not seeing _anything _left to be _done…

#v
C. G. Am. F.
So I'll _play the _strings as we _sink to the sea
C. G. Am. F.
Cuz it _turns out there's _nowhere left _I'd rather be.
C. G. Am. F.
And I'll _hold my _wife as we _lay in our bed,
C. G. Am. F.
As the _cold water _slowly seeps _up to our heads
C. G. Am. F.
And _whisper I _love you so _nothing's un_said.
F.. G. C.
As the _last life _boat drifts _out alongside the dead.

#c
C. G. Am. F.
(And the) _life_boats all _wait in the pale morning air.
C. G. Am. F.
_Don't know _if they'll _make it.
C. G. Am. F.
I _hope that _they _make it.
C. G. Am. F.
_Hope some_body _lives,
C. G. Am. F.
_Hope some_body _lives, some_where.

#o
C.. G. C.
I don't _know if they'll _make it.

C.. G. C.
But I _hope that they _make it

C. G. Am. F.
Our _new _world is so _close.
C. G. Am. F.
_Close my _eyes I can _see the streets paven with gold
