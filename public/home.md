# Solstice Resources Beta

This is a beta version of a new Solstices Resources website.

It's aiming to be interoperable with as many other formats as possible, while also making it easy to...

- [Upload](/bulk-create-versions) solstice content.
- Display [Solstice programs](/programs) in as many formats as possible. 
  - *i.e. Nice slides, printed programs, scripts that contain just lyrics, scripts that contain just speeches*
- Edit and display [songs](/songs) in as many formats as possible.
  - *i.e. converting between simple chord charts, lilypond, MuseScore, and chordmark, and transposing*
- Give [feedback](/feedback) on solstice songs and programs in a way that aggregates the data across solstices.

It imports content from secularsolstice.github.io once a day.
