# Solstice Resources Beta

This is a beta version of a new Solstices Resources website.

It imports content from secularsolstice.github.io once a day. It's aiming to be interoperable with as many other formats as possible. The goal here is to make it:

- Easy to [upload](/bulk-create-versions) solstice content.
- Easy to display [Solstice programs](/programs) in as many formats as possible. 
  - *i.e. Nice slides, printed programs, scripts that contain just lyrics, scripts that contain just speeches*
- Easy to edit and display songs in as many formats as possible.
  - *i.e. converting between simple chord charts, lilypond, MuseScore, and chordmark, and transposing*
- Easy to give feedback on solstice songs in a way that aggregates the data across solstices.
