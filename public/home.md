# Solstice Resources Beta

This is a beta version of a new Solstices Resources website. Once the kinks are ironed out, and I've integrated the old wordpress blog, I plan to move this to secularsolstice.com.

Meanwhile, I'm trying to play nicely with the existing secularsolstice.github.io website, and be interoperable with as many other formats as possible.

The goal of this site is to make it:

- Easy to upload solstice content
- Easy to display Solstice programs in as many formats as possible. *(Nice slides, printed programs, scripts that contain just lyrics, scripts that contain just speeches)*
- Easy to edit and display songs in as many formats as possible *(converting between simple chord charts, lilypond, MuseScore, and chordmark, and transposing)*

It imports content from [secularsolstice.github.io](https://secularsolstice.github.io/) once a day.

You can download all content from this website in the Power User -> Download All menu item.
