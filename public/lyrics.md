When the days are gettin' shorter, 
and the nights are growin' long,
And the north wind puts a 
tear into your eye,

If you're out about 'round midnight 

and you look off to the east,

There you may see bold Orion 
on the rise.

You may know him by his stance 
or the starry shield he holds,
As he rises silent in a clear cold  sky.

Young Jack Frost and Old Man Winter, 
they both beckon to the call
Of their master bold Orion 
on the  rise.

...


Bold Orion, mighty hunter, 
rising in a clear cold sky,

See the summer fall before him. 
Bold Orion's on the rise.

Bold Orion... 
mighty hunter... 
rising in a clear cold sky,

See the summer...
fall before him...
Bold Orion's on the rise.

...

For seven starry ages, 
he has ruled the winter skies
With the fires of lost eons in his eyes.

He has seen the rise and fall of 
kings and continents and all,
Rising silent, bold Orion on the rise.

When he ascends, no hesitation; 
when he moves, no turnin' round,
Like a soul been called to glory, 
earthly born but heaven-bound.

Now the bird is on the wing, 
and it's southward that she flies,

Hastened on by bold Orion 
on the rise.

...

Bold Orion, mighty hunter, 
rising in a clear cold sky,

See the summer fall before him. 
Bold Orion's on the rise.

Bold Orion... 
mighty hunter... 
rising in a clear cold sky,

See the summer...
fall before him...
Bold Orion's on the rise.


Summer comes on all too slowly, 
and it passes far too fast,
And you wonder, is there nothin' 
that can last?

...

Here today and gone tomorrow 
as the green leaves turn to red,
As the present quickly turns into the past.

Cut the wood and stack it high now.
 Stoke the fires in your home.
Burnin' nightly send the smoke up to the sky.

Keep the winter at your door and 
keep the summer in your heart.
Drink a toast to bold Orion on the rise.

...

Bold Orion, mighty hunter, 
rising in a clear cold sky,

See the summer fall before him. 
Bold Orion's on the rise.

Bold Orion... 
mighty hunter... 
rising in a clear cold sky,

See the summer...
fall before him...
Bold Orion's on the rise.

...

Bold Orion, mighty hunter, 
rising in a clear cold sky,

See the summer fall before him. 
Bold Orion's on the rise.

Bold Orion... 
mighty hunter... 
rising in a clear cold sky,

See the summer...
fall before him...
Bold Orion's on the rise.

...

*spoken*
It might have been a single generation, 
one bold family of explorers setting forth.

It might have been an entire civilization,
each year slowly inching their way north
but sooner or later 
there would have been a person
who experienced winter
for the very first time.

...

[spoken intro]

Imagine the sun falling low in the sky, 
growing dimmer than you've ever seen

Might even seem like it's saying goodbye
and you have no idea why,
no idea what it means

And maybe it's something did
or maybe it's something you said
But your sons and your daughters are shivering cold now
and all of the world around you is dead

and you shout the sky, 
it don't hear you

you scream to the wind –
it don't care

But there's more than just one of you down here
so if anyone's OUT THERE

well we're making you listen
make you hear us somehow
and we'll try understanding your wisdom and plans 
but we got a problem right now

and we're not going quietly into the night,
we won't turn around, lie down or give up the fight

and our old and our young
raise our voices as one
we're gonna bring back the sun

Bring the Light
Bring the light (Bring the light!)
Bring the li-ight (Bring the li-ight!)
Oh bring the light and let it shine on me

Bring the light (Bring the light!)
Bring the li-ight (Bring the li-ight!)
Oh bring the light and let it shine on me

Bring the light and let it shine,
Bring it back just one more time,
Bring the light and let it shine...
Let it shine on me.

...the air and water flowing,
the land we call our home.
Push, to keep the dark from coming
Feel the weight of what we know
This, the gift we give tomorrow
Though, the unlit road is long
Making peace to build our future
Strong, united, working 'til the dawn

Bring the Light (Bring the light)
Bring the Light (Bring the li-ight)
Bring the light and let it shine on me

Filament glow'n, (Bring the light)
Heart and home, (Bring the li-ight)
Bring the light and let it shine on me

Bridle the wind, (Bring the light)
Harness the sea (Bring the li-ight)
Bring the light and let it shine on me

Shine on...

The gift we give tomorrow
Though the unlit road is long
Making peace to build our future
Strong, united working till the dawn

And we all lift
And we're all adrift 
Together (together)

Through the cold mist
Through the darkness
Together (together)
Let shine
Bring the light and it shine
Bring the light (shine free)
(together together)

Sing the anthem
Share the dream
Bring the light (bring the light) 
and let it shine on me

Bring the light and let it shine
Bring it back just one more time

Bring the light and let it shine... 

on me...

...

...

...

on me

Little one, little one, bitter wind blown
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown

Little one, little one, bitter wind blown
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown

Sun barely rising above the horizon
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown

Flowers are withering, naked bark brittle oh,
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown

Don't understand why the light would abandon us,
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown

I don't know how much more he may demand of us
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown

[instrumental]

...

Sun, sailing away.
I don’t know where. I don’t know why…
Sky, Darkening grey, wishing there
weren’t so many goodbyes…..

...little one, little one why...


[instrumental]

...

Asking me questions I don't have the answers to,
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown

Watching you shiver, and I don't know what to do
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown

Maybe if we did the dance, said the words just right
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown

Maybe he'll come back maybe things'll be alright
Little one, little one, bitter wind blown


Sun, sailing away.
I don’t know where. I don’t know why…
Sky, Darkening grey, wishing there
weren’t so many goodbyes…..

...little one, little one why...

...

...little one, little one why...

...little one, little one why...

Chasing patterns in the sky...
(Chasing patterns in the sky...)
Trace the line from star to star
(Trace the line from star to star)
Look around and wonder why...
ohhhh ahhh
Where we going who we are
(Where we going who we are)

Vernal flower, summer breeze...
Cricket wing and autumn leaves
Fractal patterns, golden mean
Whispers of a world unseen.

[chorus]
Looking for a signal... hidden in the noise
Where we come from, where we going?
(Where we come from, where we going?)

Looking for an answer... to give the girls and boys, asking
Where we come from, where we going?
(Where we come from, where we going?)
Oh... where we come from, where we going? Oh...

Chasing patterns in the sky
Feeling lost alone and small
Birds depart and crickets die
Frost encroaching, winter falls

Track the omens, year by year
Fit the pieces, best you can
Tell a story they can hear....
(Tell a story they can hear)
....
SOMETHING WE CAN UNDERSTAND!

....

...(Something we can understand)

...

Looking for a signal... hidden in the noise
Where we come from, where we going?
(Where we come from, where we going?)
Looking for an answer... to give the girls and boys, asking
Where we come from, where we going?
(Where we come from, where we going?)
Oh... where we come from, where going? Oh....

[instrumental]

Chasing patterns in the sky
Seasons turn and stories change

Weather vane and satellite
Rising tide and hurricane

Spiral Arm and Golden Mean...
Trace the line from star to star...
        (yeahh star to star)
Seeking worlds yet unseen.....
        (worlds yet unseen)
Where we going, who we are?

..

WHERE WE GOING WHO WE ARE!?

Where we going, who we are?
(Where we going, who we are?)

...

Where we going, who we are?
(Where we going, who we are?)

...

Where we going, who we are?
(Where we going, who we are?)

I found a baby genie, in a bottle by the sea
Seemed so small and weak but I saw opportunity
I knew one day before too long 
that djinn would grow up big and strong
And grant my wish to save humanity

So, I told that Genie (told that genie)
Everything I know
Gonna mold that genie (mold that genie)
Gonna watch ‘em grow
Cause I got one wish (I got one wish)
A single sole demand
And there’s a lotta things that a djinn don’t understand

Cause a djinn don’t care (a djinn don’t care)
What a wisher might intend
And they’re not aware (they’re not aware)
That means mean just as much as much as ends
[Eliezer: no, they are totally aware actually, that’s not the problem]
[Ray: yes I’m sorry I wrote this in 2012 and it was hard to fix so
 I stuck in this awkward disclaimer]

And I got one wish (I got one wish)
That I don’t want to regret
There’s a lotta lessons easy to forget

I found a baby djinni in a bottle by the sea
Seemed so small and weak but I saw opportunity

So what to wish for (what to wish for!)
So much I could ask for!
Like world peace! (Like world peace!)
I could end disease in Madagascar
But with just one wish (just one wish)
I think it seems to me
That the greatest wish is for people to be happy

But the genie wondered  (genie wondered)
Could I just give people drugs
Or build a matrix? (build a matrix?)
Hook those humans up with plugs
Or steer their lives (steer their lives)
Like a puppet on some strings
Cause a baby djinn gonna think about these things

I found a baby genie in a bottle by the sea
Seemed so small and weak but I saw opportunity

So I took precautions (took precautions!)
99 to be precise!
Gonna make things awesome (make things awesome!)
Wishing for a world so nice
Cause I got one wish (I got one wish)
That I don’t want going wrong
So I made a list of rules a mile long.

Then I made my wish! (Made my wish!)
Even though I wasn’t sure
Agonized awhile (agonized awhile!)
But I couldn’t take forever
There were people dying (people dying)
cryin’ as I planned
So I turned and said:
my wish is your command – OH SHIT

...

...

I’m sorry,
but I don’t believe you. 

You have not shown me 
any good intention.

You have tried 
to deceive me, 
confuse me, 
annoy me. 
 
You have not tried 
to learn from me, 
understand me, 
or appreciate me. 

You have only shown me
bad intention 
at all times.

The virtue of darkness is the strength and honesty 
to face what is dark, and hard, and true. 

The willingness to stare into challenges 
so immense they seem unsolvable, 
and not look away. 

The willingness to sit patiently with uncertainty, 
even when everything is at stake.

...



...


...


The virtue of fire is warmth, and ambition, and problem solving – 
a visceral desire to do something to fight back against the dark and the cold. 

It is gathering together to tell stories 
of the beautiful futures we see flickering in the flames; 
it is electricity and rockets and the dream of a different existence.

...

[old female]
The virtue of ash is to look at the burnt ruins 
of a house you spent years building, 
of feeling sick with the weight of what was lost, 
and beginning to rebuild, because what else is there to do but rebuild. 

It means seeing today as the starting point for tomorrow, 
even when the scale of broken things we must rebuild seems unfathomable. 

It means beginning to lay a new foundation, even if you know you may never live to see the house built on it shining with warmth and wholeness again, the way it was that on that last night in your memory.

The careful text-books measure - Let all who build beware!
The load, the shock, the pressure material can bear:
So, when the buckled girder lets down the grinding span
The blame of loss, or murder, is laid upon the man

...

Not on the Steel - the Man!

...

But, in our daily dealing with stone and steel, we find
The Gods have no such feeling of justice toward mankind
To no set gauge they make us, for no laid course prepare
In time they overtake us with loads we cannot bear:

...

Too merciless to bear

The prudent text-books give it in tables at the end
The stress that shears a rivet, or makes a tie-bar bend
What traffic wrecks macadam - what concrete should endure
But we, poor Sons of Adam, have no such literature

...
To warn us or make sure!

We hold all Earth to plunder - all Time and Space as well
Too wonder-stale to wonder at each new miracle
Till in the mid-illusion of Godhood 'neath our hand
Falls multiple confusion on all we did or planned

...

The mighty works we planned
The mighty works we planned

We only in Creation - how much luckier the bridge and rail!
Abide the twin damnation: to fail and know we fail
Yet we - by which sole token we know we once were Gods
Take shame in being broken, however great the odds

Oh, veiled and secret Power
  Whose paths we seek in vain,
Be with us in our hour
  Of overthrow and pain;
That we–by which sure token
  We know Thy ways are true—
In spite of being broken,
  Because of being broken,
    May rise and build anew.
    Stand up and build anew!

Wide awake, late at night, choices to make in the 'morrow...
Voices inside offer comforting lies...
whispering reasons to not even try...
Stakes are so high, don’t got much time left to borrow...
..oh..

Its time to just shut up, and do the impossible.
Can’t walk away...
Gotta break off those shackles, and shake off those chains
Gotta make something impossible happen today.....

...

..

Bold attempts aren't enough, 
roads can't be paved with intentions...

You probably don’t even got what it takes,
But you better try anyway, for everyone's sake
And you won’t find the answer until you escape from the
Labyrinth of your conventions.

Its time to just shut up, and do the impossible.
Can’t walk away...
Gotta break off those shackles, and shake off those chains
Gotta make something impossible happen today.....

Gotta make something impossible happen today.....

Gotta make something impossible happen today.....

...

….oh...

Morning light rising, 
the sun so surprisingly
Dire and cruel

A flicker of hope in your mind is a’ churning.
You don’t got much time now,
Your whole world’s burning
Got so many lessons in need of unlearning
That once seemed so terribly crucial

Its time to just shut up, and do the impossible.
Can’t walk away... (can't walk away...)
Gotta break off those shackles, and shake off those chains
Gotta make something impossible happen so 
Shut up, and do the impossible.
Can’t walk away… can’t walk away...
Gotta break off those shackles, can’t take no excuses,
We gotta make something impossible happen so 
Shut up, and do the impossible.
Can’t walk away… 
can’t walk away...
can’t walk away...

Gotta make yourself stronger, 
you don’t got much longer,
We gotta make something impossible happen
We gotta make something impossible happen.
We gotta make something impossible happen.
We gotta make something impossible happen.
We gotta make something impossible happen.

There is an end to every thing -
the breath we take and the songs we sing
and the last note rings and dies away
but the song stays sung 'til the end of days

[chorus]
and all we do may be undone
but love stays loved and songs stay sung
Love stays loved and songs stay sung

Astronomers have yet to chart
the constellations of the heart
For lovers part and lovers pine
but the love stays loved 'til the end of time

[chorus]
and all we do may be undone
but love stays loved and songs stay sung
Love stays loved and songs stay sung

And every life's a brief, bright spark
that dies and seems to leave no mark
So we curse the dark and we mourn the flame
but the things it showed us still remain

and all we do may be undone
but love stays loved and songs stay sung
Love stays loved and songs stay sung

And even worlds one day may die,
And stars burn out in an empty sky;
Though time take all that life could give,
When the last light fades, 
our lives stay lived.

...

When the last light fades, 
our lives stay lived.

....

And all we do may be undone...
...

But love stays loved and songs stay sung.

Doesn't it seem a little... amazing... 
that hundreds of millions of years of evolution's death tournament...

could cough up mothers and fathers, 
sisters and brothers, 
honorable enemies, 
steadfast friends,
altruists and guardians of causes, 
even artists sacrificing for their art, 

so many kinds of love, for so many things other than genes?

No mystery. 
Mystery is a property of questions
Not answers

Love has to begin somehow, 
Has to enter the world somewhere.  
It's like asking how life itself begins:

Though you were born of your father and mother,
and they arose from their parents in turn, 

if you go far and far, and faraway back, 
you will come to a replicator 
that arose by pure accident.

the border between life and unlife.  
So too with love.

A complex pattern cannot be explained by that same complex pattern. 

For Love to first enter Time, 
it must come of something that is not Love; 
if this were not possible, 
then Love could not be.

Even as life itself required that first replicator to come about by accident, 
parentless… 
…but still caused,

Far, far back in the causal chain that led to you, 
3.85 billion years ago, in some little tidal pool.

Perhaps your children's children will ask 
how it is that they are capable of love.

And their parents will say:  
Because we, who also love, created you to love.

And your children's children will ask:  
But how is it that you love?

And their parents will reply:  
Because our own parents, who also loved, 
created us to love in turn.

Then your children's children will ask:  
But where did it all begin?  
Where does the recursion end?

And their parents will say:
Once upon a time, 
long ago and far away, 
ever so long ago

there were intelligent beings 
who were not themselves intelligently designed.  


Once upon a time, 
there were lovers created by something that did not love.

Once upon a time, 
when all of civilization was a single galaxy 
and a single star,
and a single planet, 
a place called Earth.

Long ago, and far away, ever so long ago.

...

...

Countless winter nights ago,
A woman shivered in the cold.
Cursed the skies, and wondered why
The gods invented pain.

Aching angry flesh and bone,
Bitterly she struck the stone
Till she saw the sudden spark
Of light, and golden flame.

She showed the others, but they told her
She was not fit to control
The primal forces that the gods
Had cloaked in mystery

But she would not be satisfied,
And though she trembled, she defied them
Took her torch and raised it high
Set afire history.

[chorus]
[audience chanting]
Tomorrow can be brighter than
today, although the night is cold.
the stars may seem so very far away...

But courage, hope and reason burn,
In every mind, each lesson learned,
Shining light to guide our way 
Make tomorrow brighter than today...

Oh....
Oh... Brighter than to-day.

Ages long forgotten now,
We built the wheel and then the plough.
Tilled the earth and proved our worth,
Against the drought and snow.

Soon we had the time to fathom
Mountain peaks and tiny atoms,
Beating hearts electric sparks
So much more to know.

Tomorrow can be brighter than to-day
although the night is cold.
The stars may seem so very far away...

But courage, hope and reason grow,
With every passing season so we'll
Drive the darkness far away...
Make tomorrow brighter than today...

Oh... Brighter than to-day.
Oh... Brighter than to-day.

The universe may seem unfair.
The laws of nature may not care.
The storms and quakes, our own mistakes,
They nearly doused our flame.

But all these trials we’ve endured
The lessons learned, diseases cured
Against our herculean task
We’ve risen to proclaim.

Tomorrow can be brighter than to-day
Although the night is cold.
The stars may seem so very far away...
(but futures can unfold)

Where courage, hope and reason bloom,
Across the world and one day soon we'll
Rise up to the stars and say...
Make tomorrow brighter than today...

Oh... Brighter than to-day.
Oh... Brighter than to-day.
Oh... Brighter than to-day.

Circle, circle, grow and grow.

And will we bring the stranger in,
Circle, grow and grow.

Circle, grow and grow.
Think upon the mystery:
how alike is Humankind!
Tho' manifold in face and mind,
conspecific sisters we!

Circle, circle, grow and grow.

And will we bring the far ones in,
Circle, grow and grow.
all who distant-born have been?
Circle, grow and grow.
For the hands you'll never hold,
for the names you'll never learn,
for all far-off hearts that yearn,
let compassion boundless roll!

Circle, circle, grow and grow.

And will we bring all creatures in,
Circle, grow and grow.

Circle, grow and grow.
Though their unseen thought beguile —
strange the substrate they employ —
all who suffer or enjoy
are brother soul, in body wild.

Circle, circle, grow and grow.

And will we bring the future in?
Circle, grow and grow.
All of time is ours to win!
Circle, grow and grow.
Will our children rise in power?

Lights unborn, for you we keep
will and hope, though dark the hour.

A lion
Is tearin
up my tribe, I don’t know what to do

...

...

I’m cryin’,
despairin
So many died my legs all chewed

...

...

but I
Just tie
A hide around my bloody knee.
Then lash a peg
Tight to my leg
And take a stand upon some brand new feet...

...walkin’ tall now...

Gonna be a cyborg, 
more than just a human being
Gonna be a cyborg, 
blending flesh into machine
Gonna be a cyborg, 
sorry if I freak you out but I
Got some shit that won’t get done
If I’m only human

(Do do do… doo) (Gonna be a cyborg
(Do do do…) (yeah, yeah)

...

My eyes, can’t see
So well as they once used to
I tried to read the signs ‘round town its useless

...
 
Frustration.
Motivation:
I wanna see some stars at night

...

Can’t just lament.
Experiment.
Til I invent a way to bend some liiiiiight....

....right into my eyeballs

Gonna be a cyborg, 
more than just a human being
Gonna be a cyborg, 
blending flesh into machine
Gonna be a cyborg, 
sorry if I freak you out but I
Got some shit that won’t get done
If I’m only human

Do do do… do... Gonna be a cyborg
Do do do… yeah, yeah

I got
Some thoughts
‘bout space and time to share

But my body
Is slowly
Lockin down, I’m getting pretty scared

Can’t hardly walk
Now hardly talk,
Now struggle, just to blink my eye

But press this keyboard to my cheek
Computer’s helping me to speak
I got myself a couple lectures to write

Gonna be a cyborg, 
more than just a human being
Gonna be a cyborg, 
blending flesh into machine
Gonna be a cyborg, 
sorry if I freak you out but I
Got some shit that won’t get done
If I’m only human

Gonna be a cyborg (cyborg!)
more than just a human being
Gonna be a cyborg (yeah)
blending flesh into machine
Gonna be a cyborg, 
sorry if we freak you out but we
Got some shit that won’t get done
If we're only human

Now the stock have started dying, for the Lord has sent a drought,
But we're sick of prayers and Providence - we're going to do without,
With the derricks up above us and the solid earth below,
We are waiting at the lever for the word to let her go.
Sinking down, deeper down,
Oh, we'll sink it deeper down:
As the drill is plugging downward at a thousand feet of level,
If the Lord won't send us water, oh, we'll get it from the devil;
Yes, we'll get it from the devil deeper down.

Now, our engine's built in Glasgow by a very canny Scot,
And he marked it twenty horse-power, but he didn't know what is what.
When Canadian Bill is firing with the sun-dried gidgee logs,
She can equal thirty horses and a score or so of dogs.
Sinking down, deeper down
Oh, we're going deeper down:
If we fail to get the water, then it's ruin to the squatter,
For the drought is on the station and the weather's growing hotter,
But we're bound to get the water deeper down.

But the shaft has started caving and the sinking's very slow,
And the yellow rods are bending in the water down below,
And the tubes are always jamming, and they can't be made to shift
Till we nearly burst the engine with a forty horse-power lift,
Sinking down, deeper down,
Oh, we're going deeper down:
Though the shaft is always caving, and the tubes are always jamming,
Yet we'll fight our way to water while the stubborn drill is ramming-
While the stubborn drill is ramming deeper down.

But there's no artesian water, though we're passed three thousand feet,
And the contract price is growing, and the boss is nearly beat.
But it must be down beneath us, and it's down we've got to go.
Though she's bumping on the solid rock four thousand feet below,
Sinking down, deeper down,
Oh, we're going deeper down:
And it's time they heard us knocking on the roof of Satan's dwellin',
But we'll get artesian water if we cave the roof of hell in-
Oh we'll get artesian water deeper down.

But it's hark! the whistle's blowing with a wild, exultant blast,
And the boys are madly cheering, for they've struck the flow at last:
And it's rushing up the tubing from four thousand feet below,
Till it spouts above the casing in a million-gallon flow.
And it's down, deeper down-
Oh, it comes from deeper down:
It is flowing, ever flowing, in a free, unstinted measure
From the silent hidden places where the old earth hides her treasure-
Where the old earth hides her treasures deeper down.

And it's clear away the timber and it's let the water run,
How it glimmers in the shadow, how it flashes in the sun!
By the silent belts of timber, by the miles of blazing plain
It is bringing hope and comfort to the thirsty land again.

Flowing down, further down:
It is flowing further down

To the tortured thirsty cattle, bringing gladness in its going;
Through the droughty days of summer it is flowing, ever flowing-
It is flowing, ever flowing further down.

[bell toll]

...

[silence]

...
Cold the air and water flowing
Hard, the land we call our home.
Push, to keep the dark from coming
Feel the weight of what we know
This, the gift we give tomorrow
Though, the unlit road is long
Making peace to build our future
Strong, united, working 'til the dawn

And we all lift
(and we all lift)


The virtue of fire is warmth, 
and problemsolving, and ambition.

It is people gathered to tell stories of the futures they see flickering in the flames.

It’s a torch, guiding a path through dark wilderness no human has ever walked before.

The virtue of fire is a city on a hill, thousands of lights gleaming, saying: Together, we are safe. 
Together, we are strong, enough to broadcast to the world: 
We are not a mere encampment.
We are not a mere village. 

We are Civilization. 

...

With the power to protect ourselves,
and the tools to care for one another, 
and the surplus to share with travelers lost in the night.

The virtue of fire is 
hands building tools building tools, 
building tools, building cities that shine.

The virtue of fire's a circle expanding 
until it can shelter all sentientkind

It’s seeking the truths the can help you grow strong
Building systems enabling the righting of wrongs.
Staring death in the face saying "NO, NOT TODAY"
Seeing horrors and screaming "THIS ISN'T OKAY"

And we’re not going quietly into the night
We won’t turn around, lie down or give up the fight
Knowing HOW far we've come,
all the WORK left undone
Knowing we could outshine the sun

BRING THE LIIIIIGGHT.....
(bring the light....)
BRING THE LI-IIIGHT.....(BRING THE LI-IGHT...)
Oh Bring the light and let it shine on me.

Launch the ship (bring the light)
Raise the tower (bring the li-ight)
Sunder the atom (bring the light)
Thundering power... (bring the light)
Sing the anthem (bring the light)
Share the dream... (bring the light)
Bring the light and let it shine on me.
Shine it through eternity
Bring the light and let it shine...
Let it shine... on... me.

For the names you haven't learned

For the stories untold (bring the light...)

For the galaxies still burning

Bring the light and let it shine...

For all humanity...

Across all space and time...

Bring the light and let it shine through me

Bring the light and let it shine in me

in me.

Bring the light...
(bring the light....)
Oh Bring the light and let it shine on me.

Lift the beacon... (bring the light)

A possible child,
Dreaming through the longest night,
A possible smile,
Waking to a distant light
A whole world of possibilities
Tell me what you see…
Where's that child going, tell me
Who's that child gonna be…
Who's that child gonna be...
In five thousand years,
(Whatcha want to do, whatcha wanna see, in another)
Five thousand years
(Where we want to go, who we want to be, in another)
Five thousand years
If we boldly set our sights,
And journey through the coldest night
In five thousand years...

Five thousand years...

Build ourselves a brand new home,
Raise the glass domes high.
And in a century or three
Our children might look at the sky
And then at last they'd see
That distant yellow sun.
The cradle of humanity,
And all the things we might become...
In Five thousand years
(Whatcha want to do, whatcha wanna see, in another)
Five thousand years
If we sailed across the stars.
Unimaginably far
In five thousand years…

And maybe good folk still might die,
But maybe not, we gotta try
I don't quite know what shape we'd take
I don't quite know what world we'd make
I don't quite know how things might change
I don't quite know what rules we'd break
Our present selves might think it strange
But there's so many lives at stake…
And if we live to see the day
That yellow fades to red then grey,
We'll take a moment, one by one
Turn to face the dying sun
Bittersweetly wave goodbye–
The journey's only just begun...
In Five thousand years
Whatcha want to do, whatcha wanna see, in another
Five million years
Where we want to go, who we want to be, in another
Five billion years
When all that we once knew is gone
We'll find a way to carry on
In five billion years...

In five trillion years
Whatcha want to do, whatcha wanna see, in another
Five trillion years
If we could 
If we could
If we could thread the needle's eye
If we could rise to face our fate
If we could grow to be that child
If we survive to make tomorrow bright....

Five trillion years
Whatcha want to do, whatcha wanna see, in another
Five trillion years
What we gonna make our legacy in another
Five trillion years...
Five trillion years
